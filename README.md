# 🛠️ Project: IT Help Desk Ticket Creation – ServiceNow

### 📝 Summary:
Created and submitted an IT support ticket using ServiceNow, simulating a real-world help desk environment. The project demonstrates knowledge of ticketing systems, issue documentation, and communication in a support context.

### 🎯 Key Objectives:
- Understand the ServiceNow platform and how IT support teams use it.
- Simulate an end-user issue and log it with accurate details.
- Track the ticket lifecycle from submission to resolution.

### 📌 What I Did:
- Accessed ServiceNow and navigated the incident management module.
- Created a new ticket describing a realistic support issue:
  Example: "Outlook crashes when opening PDF attachments."
- Included key fields such as:
  - Category: Software
  - Impact: Low
  - Urgency: High
- Short Description: *Outlook crashes when opening PDF attachments*
- Description: *User reports that Microsoft Outlook crashes every time a PDF attachment is opened. Issue started after the latest windows update. User is unable to access important email attachments.* 
- Assigned the ticket to the appropriate support group.
- Added comments to simulate communication between end user and support technician.
- Closed the ticket with a resolution note once the issue was "resolved."

### 💡 Skills Demonstrated:
- Familiarity with ITSM tools (ServiceNow)
- Ticket documentation best practices
- Communication and issue tracking
- Empathy for end-user experience


### 🧪 Tools Used:
- ServiceNow
- Windows 11 (for simulation)
